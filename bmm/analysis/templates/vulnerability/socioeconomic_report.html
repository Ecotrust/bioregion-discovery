                    <p>This report is derived from a global dataset that enumerates the number of children under 5 years of age 
                       who are underweight.  This data is being used to estimate poverty due to the current absence of a gridded
                       global poverty data layer.  
                    <p>The analysis makes the assumption that the number of underweight children directly corresponds to the number
                       of children living in poverty for a given region.  Using this enumeration of underweight children, 
                       an estimate is derived of the total population living in poverty within this bioregion.  
                    <p>To estimate the total poverty population we first estimate the proportion of the world's impoverished
                       contained within this bioregion.  This is achieved by dividing the number of underweight children reported
                       in this bioregion by the estimated number of underweight children under the age of 5 worldwide
                       (<a href="http://www.who.int/whosis/whostat/EN_WHS2011_Part1.pdf" target="_blank">estimated at 115 million</a>).  
                    <p>We then estimate the number of people living in poverty by multiplying the proportion of the world's impoverished,  
                       as estimated, by the global population of impoverised (as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty" target="_blank">estimated on Wikipedia</a>
                       as 1.7 billion in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_threshold" target="_blank">absolute poverty</a>).
