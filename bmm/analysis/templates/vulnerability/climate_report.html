                    <p>This report is an indicator of the Global Climate-Demography Vulnerability Index (CDVI) which is 
                       estimated by subtacting climate vulnerabilities from demographic annual growth rates.  
                       In this case, high vulnerability is predicted for regions where a decline in climate conditions 
                       currently supporting high population density is combined with rapid population growth.
                    <p>CDVI < -12 is considered Low,
                    <p>-12 <= CDVI < -4 is Moderately Low,
                    <p>-4 <= CDVI < 4 is Moderate,

<h3>Rising Sea Levels (1 meter)<sup><small><a id="displayText" href="javascript:toggleDiv('sea_rise_1m');">Learn More</a></small><sup></h3>
    <div id="sea_rise_1m" style="display: none">
        <p>The following reports estimate the loss of terrestrial area and the number of displaced people that would result from a 1 meter rise in sea levels.
        <p>The loss of land is calculated through a simple summation of the sea rise grid cells that intersect the bioregion.  
        <p>The displaced population report relied on a resampling (using nearest neighbor) of the sea rise data layers from 
           an original grid cell measuring 1 km on a side, to grid cells that are 5 km on a side.  This new larger cell size reflects 
           the cell size of the population layer which was used in the overlay to estimate the displaced population.  
        <p>NOTE:  The Population Displacement report is very much an estimate.  It is based on current (2005) population levels while 
           significant sea level rise is not expected in the immediate future (by which time the population could have changed 
           significantly).  More importantly, the datasets used in the calculations have a significantly large cell size (5 km on a side), 
           producing very rough population displacement estimates.
